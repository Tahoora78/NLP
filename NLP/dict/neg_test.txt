it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing .
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
narc is all menace and atmosphere .
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected .
well-made but mush-hearted .
humor in i spy is so anemic .
the film is strictly routine .
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar .
 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
at times , it actually hurts to watch .
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 .
insufferably naive .
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
